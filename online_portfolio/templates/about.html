        <p class="paragraph">

            I am a student of Computer Science for my love and passion for innovative technology. I aim to become a software engineer to fulfil this passion, as well as to be a part of the great technological era that we live in. I currently reside in Mexico City and I attend the University Tecnologico de Monterrey. The thing that I really like about technology and specially coding is the ability to create and innovate. And that is why I love coding the most, because you can make virtually anything and can help millions of people. Although I love technology the most I also really like design, which I never thought would be possible because most of my high school years I thought of myself as a numbers and logic person, and never really got into artsy things until now, and I really like it! I also really like music and philosophy, which as well are things I thought I will never get into. Another thing about me is that I really enjoy sports and being active. I have been playing sport and doing exercise since I have memory and I couldn’t picture myself not living without doing some sort of exercise. My favorite sport, hands down, has to be swimming. I’ve met so many close and had so many memorable experiences that it just holds a special place in my life.
